## Overview
Partner Center Sell supports onboarding both 3rd party (Business Parter or ISV) and 1st party (IBM) products to IBM Catalog.

## Detailed Information

Partner Center Sell manages the governance workflows which allow the providers of software content and managed services to onboard their products into the IBM Cloud catalog. These workflows vary depending on whether the provider is 1st party (IBM) or 3rd party (ISV or Business Partner), the type of offering (managed service), and architecture variations within the type of offering (provision behind vs. provision through, Helm Chart vs. Operator vs. Terraform etc.). The workflows include business and technical tasks, as well as tasks that IBM reviewers must approve before offerings can be promoted to their next phase or step, based on service framework governance.

For more details, refer to the PCS [TRI](https://github.ibm.com/LOX/Product-Lifecycle-Architecture/blob/master/TRI/GA.md).
