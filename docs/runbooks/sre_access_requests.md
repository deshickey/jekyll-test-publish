# Access requests for IKS SRE Squad

## Overview

This document details how new SRE members should onboard to the Worldwide SRE squad.

Work with your local squad lead to get your access granted and your workstation setup ready.

You should begin by completing the [production onboarding checklist](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/process/production_onboarding.html).


### Prerequisites

<span stype="color:red">*IMPORTANT*:</span> Mandatory trainings and WST security compliance *MUST* be completed before any access request to be submitted. Non-conformance will result in violating `Control HR.02 - Late Completion of Mandatory courses`.

- **AccessHub access**
Login to [AccessHub](https://ibm-support.saviyntcloud.com/ECMv6/request/requestHome)

- **IBM GitHub userid**  
Before you start onboarding, please ensure that you already have logged on to IBM GitHub and that a GitHub userid has been created for you - to achieve this go to [https://github.ibm.com](https://github.ibm.com).  
_Log on, if necessary, using the w3id federation. If you click on the top most right icon, github should show you as signed in._  
_**If you create a new user, please allow AccessHub half a day to discover and synchronize your new userid!**_

  Without a valid user in IBM GitHub, the AccessHub onboarding will fail.

### Before you begin notes
- If you are not familiar with AccessHub, usage steps are outlined here. [Using AccessHub](../process/access_control_using_accesshub.html#how-to-use-accesshub)
- Focus on Yubikey, IKS Access & Service Now as these are primary blockers.
[Yubikey Starting point](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/sre_access_requests.html#setting-up-global-protect-vpn)
- Do **not** accept __"You are invited to join an account"__ email until **after** your yubikey is setup as joining a yubikey MFA account without a yubikey will disable all IBMCloud and Service Now access. The join invitation is vaild for 30 days.  
- The steps below will differ slightly if you are new to IBM (**Select Request Access for Self**) or an Existing IBMer with some access already (**Select Manage My Access**).


## Detailed Information

### AccessHub request for an SOS IDMgt

SOS IDMgt is required to connect to vpn and IBM Cloud machines. Hence, user have to remember the username he/she provides during the process.

**NOTE** An `SOS IDMgt ID` is required to connect to vpn and IBM Cloud machines. Make sure the ID is unique and easy to remember as it will be used to login to IBM Cloud machines. Existing usernames are not checked by SOS IDMgt so, if the ID is not unique, it causes complications for the SRE squad. If in doubt, check with the SRE squad.

1. Go to [AccessHub](https://ibm-support.saviyntcloud.com/ECMv6/request/requestHome).
1. Click on **Request New Access for Self** or **Manage My Access** 
1. Search for **SOS IDMgt** in the **Applications** search box.
1. Enter a **Account Name** for yourself
_for example, use your intranet short name_
_NB: This must NOT clash with any local user account on any machine - see NOTE above_
1. In the **Brand Type** field type **BU044-ALC**
1. Click **Add**.
1. Find the group `BU044-ALC-Conductor`
   _You can use the search box to find it quickly._
   - if you are an EU member, also `BU044-ALC-Conductor_EU`
1. Click **Select** on each of the above.
1. When you have added all the **Groups** you are requesting, click on **Done** at the bottom of the page.
1. Click **Review & Submit**
1. Enter a **business justification**.
   _This should detail the `squad` you are in, the `region` you are in (important for EU confirmation), and the reason you need access to each `group and role`._
1. Confirm your details and **Tick** the box.
1. Click **Submit**


#### Removal of AccessHub entitlements after period of SOS inactivity

Note that if the SOS ID has been inactive for a period of time, production entitlements in AccessHub will be revoked. Please see the [How to restore SOS IDMgt entitlements](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/sre_restoring_sos_idmgt_entitlements.html) runbook.

### Setting up Global Protect VPN

This section is for creating an account in the Softlayer (Commercial) environment and setting up temporary access using Symantec VIP App and permanent access using Yubikey.

_as per [Setting up Global Protect VPN](#setting-up-global-protect-vpn) above_

The following steps explain required configuration process

#### 1. Register the SoftLayer (SL) FIPS-enable Yubikey as IAM MFA

Follow one of these two options:

- **If Yubi key was shipped BEFORE 2021-June-23**:

   1. Install Yubi Key manager, Download the package from [yubico](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/)
   2. Raise a [SL ticket](https://internal.softlayer.com/Ticket/addInternal) to arrange a web session with SL team (sample task [138115810](https://internal.softlayer.com/Ticket/ticketEdit/138115810)).  
   NB. Availability time slots **need** to be specified
   1. During websession,SL unlocks the key
   1. During websession, [Add SL Yubi key to IBM Cloud Account Security authentication](#2-adding-fips-enabled-yubikey-to-ibm-cloud-account)
   1. During web session, SL support locks the key again  
   SL Ticket:
   ```
   Group: Help Desk
   Subject: Yubikey/2FA
   request that FIDO module be unlocked
   ```
   
- **If Yubi key was shipped AFTER 2021-June-23**:
   1. SL team ship a SL key unlocked and without FIPS mode
   1. The key comes with an instructions on how to register the key with Softlayer (IaaS) 
   1. Install Yubi Key manager, Download the package from [yubico](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/)
   1. Raise a [SL ticket](https://internal.softlayer.com/Ticket/addInternal) to arrange a web session with SL team (sample task 138115810). Available time slots need to be specified
   1. During websession, [Add SL Yubi key to IBM Cloud Account Security authentication](#2-adding-fips-enabled-yubikey-to-ibm-cloud-account)
   1. During web session, SL support sets FIPS mode and locks the key 
     ```
   Group: Help Desk
   Subject: Yubikey/2FA
   request that FIDO module be locked
   ```

#### 2. Adding FIPS-enabled Yubikey to IBM Cloud Account

1. Go to the [IBM Cloud Two Factor Authentication](https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/mysecurity/index.jsp) page
   - You need to identify yourself with two different methods - usually Email and Text (SMS)
1. Authenticate using both methods
1. Go to the `Manage additional authentication factors` section and expand
1. Click `Add` and for `Add Authentication Factor` select `U2F` in the drop-down list
1. Give the U2F key a name (e.g. `SL Security Key`) and click `Register Key`

### VPN Access

#### Two-factor authentication set-up

To connect to stage, production, and support account OpenVPNs, you **must** use two-factor authentication. This means that when you want to log in to a 2FA-enabled OpenVPN you will need both your `SOS-IDMgt` ID and password (from AccessHub) and a registered device where a push notification will be sent. You will no-longer need the 6 digit code.

Follow these simple steps to get setup.

1. Enroll your mobile device on [Identity@IBM](https://ibm-device-enroll.prod.identity-services.intranet.ibm.com/)
1. Install the DUO application from the Apple or Android store.

Further documentation is on [2FAaaS User Enrollment Guide](https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W9b145d60814d_40a2_b53b_657ff324b22a/page/2FAaaS%20User%20Enrollment%20Guide%20and%20Device%20Changes)

#### Tunnelblick setup for MacOS

If your on a mac and make use of the Tunnelblick client.

1. Download VPN client config files from [GHE repo](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/openvpn-clients/tree/static/final-dst-automation)
1. Double click the config files you downloaded in the previous instructions and they will be added to your connections list.
1. Edit each config file to enable 2FA by changing from `auth-user-pass /openvpn/ldap-login.txt` to `auth-user-pass`

Tunnelblick will prompt you for access detail when connecting and you should enter your SOS-IDMgt username and credentials (from USAM)

_Tip: If Tunnelblick prompt you to use `down-root` plugin click on `Do not use the plugin` button._

More information on VPN access is available on [VPN Access](./vpn.html) runbook.

#### EU Vyatta Access
_Note: Netint cannot access EU vyattas, SRE needs access on their behalf._

First of all, it is necessary to get a request approved in AccessHub for ROLE_IKS_SRE-DE and ROLE_IKS_SRE-IE for the user to be added to EU vyattas.

EU SREs need to add their public key to https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-netint/firewall-source/blob/master/vyatta/users.json

1. Create a new [Firewall Request issue](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-netint/firewall-requests/issues/new?template=firewall-request.md) filling up the required fields in the issue template.

1. Edit the file `users.json` in the [firewall-source repository](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-netint/firewall-source/blob/master/vyatta/users.json), filling out the below template and adding an entry to the file 

   ```
   "<Unique-ID-For-Json-File>": {
      "level": "admin",
      "email": "<User-Email>",
      "keys": [
         {
               "public-key": "<PUBLIC-KEY>",
               "type": "<Encryption-Type>",
               "id": "<ID-Used-Create-Key>"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

1. Create a PR with the changes. The creator of the PR needs to add a comment on the PR with the following "diff looks fine", this is for compliance for the request.
Example PR: https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-netint/firewall-source/pull/1618

1. Add a link to the firewall request issue in the PR.
Example issue: https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-netint/firewall-requests/issues/3682

More information about Vyatta Firewall Access can be found [here](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/process/access_control_vyatta_access.html).

The process may take up to 24 hours to roll out once the PR is merged and the access is granted.
