## Overview
Schematics is an IBM Cloud service, that delivers Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools as a service. You can use the capabilities of Schematics to consistently deploy and manage your cloud infrastructure environments.

## Detailed Information

Schematics builds on open-source Ansible, Terraform to provide a powerful set of IaC tools as a service to program your cloud infrastructure. With Schematics you can use this rich set of IaC automation capabilities to build stacks of cloud resources, manage their lifecycle, manage changes in their configurations, deploy your app workloads, and perform day-2 operations.

The three core Schematics offerings are:
   1. Schematics workspaces
   1. Schematics actions
   1. Schematics agents
