## Troubleshoot issues related to CPU or Memory utlization

`kubectl top` command can be used to retrieve snapshots of resource utilization of pods or nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. Resource utilization is an important thing to monitor for Kubernetes cluster owners. In order to monitor resource utilization, you can keep track of things like CPU, memory.

### kubectl top node
Running the `kubectl top node` command lists metrics of the current nodes
```
Mayanks-MacBook-Pro:~ mayank$ kubectl top node
NAME            CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%   
10.221.2.11     286m         7%     2829Mi          21%       
10.221.2.18     535m         6%     4385Mi          15%       
10.221.2.2      400m         10%    2672Mi          20%       
10.221.2.21     523m         6%     5165Mi          18%       
10.241.131.32   803m         10%    5418Mi          19%       
10.241.131.37   409m         5%     4367Mi          15%       
10.241.131.51   469m         11%    2773Mi          21%       
10.241.131.58   420m         10%    2683Mi          20%       
10.73.2.119     286m         7%     2772Mi          21%       
10.73.2.125     301m         7%     2675Mi          20%       
10.73.2.75      598m         7%     4635Mi          16%       
10.73.2.79      342m         4%     4590Mi          16% 
```

The output from kubectl top node gives you information about CPU(cores), CPU%, memory, and memory%. Letâ€™s see what these terms mean:

* CPU(cores)

  `535m means 535 millicpu. 1000m is equal to 1 CPU, hence 535m means 53.5% of 1 CPU.`

* CPU%

  `It is displayed only for nodes, and it stands for the total CPU usage percentage of that node.`

* Memory

  `Memory being used by that node`

* Memory%

  `It is also displayed only for nodes, and it stands for total memory usage percentage of that node.`


### kubectl top pod
Running the `kubectl top pod` command displays the metrics about pods from the default namespace.

```
