## Overview

This runbook describes how do add users to an IBM Infrastructure account (Softlayer) and if you have navigated to this from a search of the docs, you should consult the [IBM Cloud account management runbook](./ibmcloud_account_management.html) before continuing with any further steps.

## Detailed information

_Note: this runbook previously covered the details for managing SoftLayer users and permissions directly, but that functionality has been migrated to AccessHub._

Classic Infrastructure permissions for users are controlled via AccessHub.

Please consult the following documentation on [IBM Cloud account management runbook](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/ibmcloud_account_management.html) and [Accesshub user management](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/process/access_control_using_accesshub.html) for more information, and reach out to SREs if you have any further questions.
