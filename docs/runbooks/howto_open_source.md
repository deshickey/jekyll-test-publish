## Overview
This is a quick document listing the process to participate in an external open source project (eg hosted on github.com).
  
The top level page for IBMs open source project is:
* https://w3.ibm.com/developer/opensource
  

### Background
IBM allows its employees to take part in open source projects, but you must go through the approval process first.
This document links to the information needed to go through that process.

## Detailed Information
The informaiton specific to contributing is here:
* https://w3.ibm.com/developer/opensource/contribute/contributions/
  
In order to take part in open source, you will need to get permission through a repository called `WICKED`
you will need to set up an account to use the tool
The process is explained in the above link.
  
Here is an example for providing a single fix to a slack library we use:
* https://wicked-proposals.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/proposal/3fc0775f-9268-4131-9955-6dde75dc32fd
  
NOTE: Once submitted, your manager will need to approve it - they do not seem to get notification so you will need to tell them yourselves.
Also they will need to make an account in WICKED to be able to approve your request.
  
Once your manager has approved - it will go to a business level approver - and once they have approved, you can then work on the external open source project - to the scope that you have been given permission.
  
If you need to make changes beyond the scope you have approval for, you will need to make an additional WICKED request.
