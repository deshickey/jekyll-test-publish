## Overview

Weâ€™ve enabled the NodeRestriction admission controller for improved cluster security. NodeRestriction admission plugin limits a kubelet to modify only its own Node API object, and Pod API objects that are bound to their node. More details [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction)

## Detailed Information

On carrier worker nodes we have set default kubeconfig as restricted-kubelet-kubeconfig for increasing security by giving restricted permissions to the user `system:node:<nodeName>`, earlier it was set to kubelet-kubeconfig.
You can check current kubeconfig using
~~~~~
echo $KUBECONFIG

/etc/kubernetes/restricted-kubelet-kubeconfig
~~~~~

### Permission Failure

On worker nodes you may see permission errors while running kubectl commands as mentioned below:
~~~~~
kubectl get al -n kube-system | grep action

Error from server (Forbidden): correctiveactions.workerrecovery.stable is forbidden: User "system:node:10.131.16.97" cannot list resource "correctiveactions" in API group "workerrecovery.stable" in the namespace "kube-system"
~~~~~

### Solution

Any one action can be taken from below:
- Run the commands on master node
- On worker node, switch to root user
  ~~~~~
  sudo su -
  kubectl get al -n kube-system | grep action

  action-label-10.130.231.140   15m
  action-label-10.130.231.188   23h
  action-label-10.131.16.55     45h
  ~~~~~
- On worker node, use kubelet kubeconfig
  ~~~~~
  kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-kubeconfig get al -n kube-system | grep action

  action-label-10.130.231.140   19m
  action-label-10.130.231.188   23h
  action-label-10.131.16.55     45h
  ~~~~~
