## Overview

All Alchemy squads use a compbination of [USAM](https://usam.svl.ibm.com:9443/AM/) and [AccessHub](https://ibm-support.saviyntcloud.com/ECMv6/request/requestHome) to manage user access to productions systems an services.  Each squad service group has a development, pre-staging, staging, and production environment. 

The Conductor squad (SRE) should request the Conductor role granting them access to all environments.

## Detailed Information

#### Before requesting access to production systems

**Attention: You must first follow the [production onboarding process](../process/production_onboarding.html) before requesting access to production systems.**

This is a legal requirement for HIPAA because some of the Armada systems may contain Protected Health Information.

#### Request access to the various systems

Use the [access control process documents](../process/access_control.html)
