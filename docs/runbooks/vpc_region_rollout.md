### Detailed Procedure

### Planning
The projected capacity of the VPC region rollout needs to consider VPC [Quotas and service limits](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas) per region/account. The baseline resource capacity projection is an estimate from an existing classic prod region.  
- (per region account set up) The VPC resource capacity planning of quotas such as CPU, memory from largest Classic regions(us-south and eu-de) can be referenced. The maximum VPC resource capacity can be planned and requrested during an account set-up. 
- (per deploy) The capacity planning of control plane size can start with smaller to medium sized control plane WP size and scale up/down Barge WPs with [automation](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/barge-deploy-module/tree/main/worker-pool).  

### VlanSubnets
(per deploy)(A) This is provisioned by VPC deployment automation. Each time a barge is deployed, new set of VLANs and subnets are to be defined. 

### OpenVPN
Barge access is via a client-to-site VPN server in the VPC environment with a self-signed cert. The access is controlled by a pre-existing secret group to help limit access to certain secret types. The access is RBAC. 

(per deploy)(A) The certs created in `new` account. The VPN config files with client cert are uploaded to a Secret Manager in `support` account- pre-req 7. The secret group is automatically mapped to the certs during uploading. 
- The `barge-vpn-configs` secret group is used to allow product teams to access the VPCs VPN config file, which is currently required to access each barge.
- config file is uploaded to a SM with naming convention of `<env>-<region>-barge<num>-vpn-config` 
ie. dev-us-east-barge1-vpn-config

### InfraMachineOrder
(per deploy)(A) This is provisioned by barge deployment automation. Masters and workers in workers pools are provisioned with RHCOS.

### Bastion
PAG is planned to rollout in Q3/2024.

### sDNLB
#### 1. SDNLB pre-req
1. Service ID for Each SDNLB in new account is created in pre-req. 
1. After Service IDs are created, get service account/IDs authorized by sDNLB team so that sDNLB operations are allowed. Request can be raised in #ibmcloud-service-dnlb. SDNLB request PR needs to be merged before proceeding in https://github.ibm.com/nextgen-environments/global-prod 
1.  secret for SDNLB is created by [Barge deploy automation](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/barge-deploy-module/blob/main/module/sdnlb-kube-secret-module/main.tf#L17-L34) 

#### 2. SDNLB for microservice
   - Deploying SNNLB for microservice is collaboration between SRE and Network team.
   - (per region account set up)(A) a private catalog & VPE object is created by Barge deploy automation 
      - catalog name: pre-prod sdnlb, prod sdnlb
      - VPE objects in catalog: <ENV>_V<barge number>_SDNLB_VPE_<region>
   - (per region account set up)(A) Istio/Ingress team deploys SDNLB 
   - (per region account set up)(M) SRE creates VPE GW

#### 3. SDNLB for masters
   - Deploying SDNLB for masters needs to be set up by SRE
   - (per deploy) (A) VPE object in a shared private catalog is created post Barge deploy 
   - (per deploy) (A) SDNLB service is deployed in namespace `kube-config`

### Serviceendpoint
VPE for IBM cloud services are stored in [barge-deploy-module](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/barge-deploy-module/blob/29bdfb20c59ec9e9a29ffae5f049ac13938e7357/scaffold/dev/us-east/env.hcl#L45)
VPE for armada-api and masters are created as part of SDNLB set-up.
- VPE for masters is `v<num>-<region>.private.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
- VPE for microservice is `<region>.private.containers.cloud.ibm.com`

### ETCDInstanceSetup
(per region account set up) Details in armada-etcd set up [runbook](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/etcd-setup-new-region.html)

#### 1. CreateICDInstance
   - (per region account set up)(A) PR automation for ETCD and KP are integrated into barge deployment pipeline. 
   - Corresponding PRs to be manually approved and promoted to env where Barge is deployed.

#### 2. COSCredentialsSetup
   - This remains manual step. details in armada-etcd set up [runbook](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/etcd-setup-new-region.html)

#### 3. CreateCOSConfigfile
   - This remains manual step. details in armada-etcd set up [runbook](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/etcd-setup-new-region.html)

#### 4. ETCDMigraion
   - This remains manual step. details in armada-etcd set up [runbook](https://pages.github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/documentation-pages/docs/runbooks/etcd-setup-new-region.html)

### CreateArmadaClusterSecrets

- (per region account set up)(A) Config-Pusher PR automation. This is a standard practice when setting up a new environment inorder to capture the infrastructure utilisation metrics. The automation is work is planned.</br>
SRE is expected to raise a PR with the skeleton strucuture, sample PR https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-containers/armada-config-pusher/pull/1910

### Useronboarding
(A) The users are assigned to a openshift role based on IAM groups. IAM groups are pre-defined in role-config. The changes are needed to be made to configure in [barge-user-sync](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/barge-user-sync/tree/main/deployment/overlays)

Use following guide to define values in configmap.yaml

`user-sync.yaml`
- `account_id`: Account id where barge is deployed
- `users`: Map of users configuration for kind of users (i.e. sre, viewer)
   - user-type:
      - `group`: An OpenShift group to be defined in barge cluster
      - `access_group`: Corresponding access group/s on the cloud account

`group-sync.yaml`
- `groups`: OpenShift group mapping with appropriate access  
   _This list needs to match with groups defined in user-sync.yaml_
   - `name`: An OpenShift group name defined in user-sync.yaml
   - `clusterRoles`: List of clusterroles to bind to the OpenShift group

### BargePipelineAutomation

1. Phase : VPC Creation
 The input values are controlled by config file version control. 

```
### VPC Creation
VPC Name: <hub-vpc, spoke-vpc, satellite-vpc> # RG with a same name is created
ENV: 
# change management (ops train)
TODO details to follow
```

1. Phase: Barge Deploy
The stable deploy pipeline is located in [containers prod Jenkins](https://alchemy-containers-jenkins.swg-devops.com/view/Conductors/job/stable-barge-pipeline/)
The input parameters

```
region: <us-south, us-east..>
env_level: <dev, prestage, stage, prod>
barge_number: <single digit, example, 1 >
openshift_bom: <major version, example, 4.15>

# PR automation

### StatusCakeSetup
Replaced by IBM Cloud Synthetics [GHE Issue](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/development/issues/1188) to track rollout 

### Observability
[sysdig set up GHE issue](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/barge-deploy/issues/265)
[armada - dashboard setup GHE issue](https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/barge-deploy/issues/296)

### BargeDeprovisioning
Dangerous! Proceed with caution. This will delete everything about Barge. Use the jenkins job https://alchemy-conductors-jenkins.swg-devops.com/job/Conductors/job/Barge/job/barge-pipeline-cleanup/

### Bootstrap
