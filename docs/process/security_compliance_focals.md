## Security, Compliance and Privacy Focals for Argonauts

A number of our processes and procedures require people with specific roles to focus on important aspects of how we develop and operate our services.

The specific roles are:

- [Security Focal](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/Security/strategy/Security-Focals.html): the primary contact person within a product development team with a specific responsibility for driving security awareness, training and best practice within their team.

- [Compliance Focal](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/Security/strategy/service-compliance-focal.html): the primary contact person, within a service team, who is ultimately responsible for Compliance activities. The SCF establishes offering information and is the primary interface to support Trust and Assurance.

- Privacy Focal: the primary contact person within a product development team with a specific responsibility for supporting privacy matters relevant to the service. The SPF establishes service information to provide privacy transparency, respond to inquiries, and ensure that appropriate contractual and security requirements are in place to protect the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) held by the service.

- [GM Security Focal](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/Security/strategy/tribe-security-leader.html): the primary contact points for all security and compliance matters related to the services that are supported within their IBM Public Cloud tribe or business segment. GM Security Focals are responsible for driving security and compliance awareness across the services within their tribe or business segment's portfolio, ensuring the Service Security Focals and Service Compliance Focals are trained and engaged, and championing security and compliance best practices.
