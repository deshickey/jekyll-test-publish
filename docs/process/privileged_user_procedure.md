This document details the privileged user and machine procedure in the Argonauts Tribe

## Definition of privileged users

Privileged users are defined in [IT Security Standard (ITSS) Section 3.2 Privileged User Responsibilities](https://w3.ibm.com/#/support/article/itss/au?requestedTopicId=au&section=3.3.2). 

> defined as any user with the ability to make changes on any production system, to access production IBM Customer data, or to access any IBM product source code

This means that anyone with access to IBM Github Enterprise (GHE) is a privileged user and therefore must complete the actions in the next section. 

## Responsibilities and actions

Privileged user responsibilities are defined in [IT Security Standard (ITSS) Section 3.2 Privileged User Responsibilities](https://w3.ibm.com/#/support/article/itss/au?requestedTopicId=au&section=3.3.2). 

- Meet all General User Responsibilities.

  **Action**: Follow the responsibilities described in [3.1 General User Responsibilities](https://w3.ibm.com/#/support/article/itss/au?requestedTopicId=au&section=3.3.1).

- Register themselves as a Privileged User via IBM's Privileged User registration process.

  **Action**: Follow the [IBM's Privileged User registration process](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cio-cybersecurity-assurance/services/cybersecurity-tooling-devops/beekeeper-faq#PrivilegedUser) to register as a privileged user. [Beekeeper](https://ibm.biz/beekeeper) is the tool for showing privileged user classification during audits. 

- Not use personally owned devices for IBM privileged activities (i.e. No BYOD).

  **Action**: Personally owned devices must not be used for privileged activities, such as accessing IBM product source code. 

- Comply with any other Privileged User requirements defined by their Business Units.

  There are currently no extra Privileged User requirements for IBM Cloud. Review the [IBM Cloud Security Policy](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/Security/policy/Security-Policy.html) for any new requirements.

- Comply with all Non-IBM user responsibilities if a non-IBM user.

  **Action**: If a contractor or other Non-IBM User, follow the responsibilities described in [3.3 Non-IBM User Responsibilities](https://w3.ibm.com/#/support/article/itss/au?requestedTopicId=au&section=3.3.3)
