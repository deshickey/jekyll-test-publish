Policy
{: .label .label-purple}

## Brief scope

This policy covers access control specific to requesting access to the Argonauts Slack team.

## Roles requiring access

- Member of the Argonauts tribe


## Roles authorised to approve access

- Slack workspace administrator

## Roles authorised to process the request

- Slack workspace administrator

## Requesting access

If you are in the Argonauts tribe then access to the Argonauts slack workspace can be requested.

- Navigate to https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/signin/find-workspaces
- Search for `Argonauts`
- Click `request to join` button.

A request will go to the `Slack workspace administrators`

## Approval process

The `Slack workspace administrators` monitor a channel in argonauts slack where all requests to join are sent.
If the user is eligible to join, the administrator will approve the request.
If the user is not eligible to join, the request will be rejected.
Reasoning will be added to the slack channel for both cases.


## Removal process

On leaving IBM, the users access will be revoked as it is linked to IBMID.

On leaving the department, the manager of the employee should raise a [conductors team issue] asking for them to be removed from slack.
