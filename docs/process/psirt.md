## Product Security Incident Report Tool (PSIRT)

We follow the IBM [PSIRT](https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W70f147e878c7_470e_b8d8_90a83ef5e87b) process to identify, assess and track remediation of security vulnerabilities in our code or third party software we run.

We use the [PSIRT Tool](https://psirt.raleigh.ibm.com/) to do so (intranet ID authentication).

## Cloud Offerings

[This page](https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W70f147e878c7_470e_b8d8_90a83ef5e87b/page/Additional%20considerations%20for%20Cloud%20offerings) has the most relevant information for cloud offerings.

[This training video](https://ibm.box.com/s/3fig31rvcvobp2tnfxhi4ao99pz0sfqs) was recorded by Andrew Akehurst-Ryan in 2018 for the SRE team. It covers the most common PSIRT tasks and has some Q&A too.

**Attention:** if the vulnerable software runs in the cloud environments we manage (regardless of whether it is IBM or third party software), we must also patch our environments within the ITSS policy time limits. The ITSS time limits are much stricter than those of PSIRT and could be as little as 24 hours for the most critical issues. Refer to the [Vulerability Management Process](vulnerability_management.html) for further details.

## Key Contacts

- Our PSIRT Responders are members of the SRE squad.

- Our PSIRT Pillar Lead is Dan Cox (Daniel Cox/Arlington/IBM), who can help with most day-to-day PSIRT questions.

## Where To Get Help

The [PSIRT Community](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/communities/service/html/communitystart?communityUuid=707492f9-bc2b-4556-b474-69c91e0b3db2) has PSIRT information and help forums. Note that the PSIRT tool changed a few years ago, so some of the older information there is outdated.

Ask the PSIRT Pillar Lead or one of the central PSIRT contacts for an invitation to the community.
