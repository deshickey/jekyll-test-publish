# Enforce new hire role-based training with evidence that was completed

## Purpose

Document mandatory learning for new hires and we enforce new hire role-based training with evidence that was completed

## Scope

Role Based Training guidance defines role-based security training requirements for each role (https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/Security/guidance/role-based-training.html).

All personnel must complete mandatory role-based security training:

- Prior to being granted access to systems required to perform their role (e.g., new hires);
- Upon a significant change in the environment or process. If during the year there are significant changes requiring immediate additional training, all applicable employees in a particular role will be required to take this additional training; and
- At least annually.

IBM managers must ensure required role-based security training is completed BEFORE authorizing access to the information system or performing assigned duties, when a new user joins a team:

- As a new employee;
- As a transfer from a different IBM team/organization; or
- As a change in job role within their current team.
  
When determining what training is required for employees, it should be based on role. It is recommended that managers use the [Job Role Advisor tool](https://ibm.biz/JobRoleAdvisor) to ensure their employees are in the proper role, that these roles align as much as possible with the IBM Public Cloud roles and the employee's specialties are properly defined. See Roles Guidance for [defined roles](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/Security/guidance/roles.html).
