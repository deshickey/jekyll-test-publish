# Emergency Access Process

A requirement as part of HIPAA Control 44, Action 1 is to provide an emergency logical access process. This document details that procedure.

## Steps

* In case of emergency, a senior manager may approve of temporary access before onboarding is complete.
* A senior manager must communicate emergency approval to the HIPAA Focal (as named in the [Security Compliance Focals](security_compliance_focals.html)) via official IBM email. Emergency approval can be granted after such email is sent.
* Any emergency access granted must be temporary in nature, and be limited to no more than 5 business days.
* Should the team member require access beyond the 5 business day period, they must complete all onboarding steps. All boarding steps must be completed within the same 5 day business period.
* Any member who has been given emergency access, must never be allowed access again unless they completed all onboarding steps.
