## RCA process objectives
- Document identified compliance gaps/risks 
   - Gather related evidence in case the gap/risk is detected during audit.  Collecting relevant evidence when the issue is recent is simpler than trying to piece together evidence months after the event.
- Identify root cause of miss/risk
- Determine preventative measures to eliminate recurrence of gap/risk and document action plan to fix

## Instructions
When a compliance gap/risk is detected by the compliance team they will raise an RCA issue using issue template https://github.ibm.com/alchemy-conductors/security/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Compliance%2C+RCA%2C+Gap&template=root-cause-analysis.md&title=RCA+%5Bcompliance-item+eg+image+vulnerability%5D+gap

- First pass at RCA should be completed withing 1 week of RCA creation.
- It is the owning managers responsibility to ensure timely completion of the RCA.
- It is the owning managers responsibility to ensure the RCA has met the objectives of the RCA process.
- The owning team should complete all sections of the RCA including as much detail as possible, including links to all relevant issues, files, process documentation etc. as evidence  
   - If links to Slack threads are included, briefly summarise the important parts in case the reviewers do not have access to the Slack channel 
- The completed RCA requires sign-off from the owning manager, compliance team member, compliance team manager

## RCA raising criteria

- Likelihood of gap detection and followup during an audit is moderate - high (and we therefore benefit from timely collection of compensating evidence)
examples:
   - late execution of regularly performed controls that are tested for audit, such as pentests, security reviews, HC reviews etc.
   - systemic compliance gaps without PCE, or on a significant proportion of the inventory such that the probability of sampling a gap is not remote

- Repeated compliance failures in the same area, suggesting process/automation weakness needing improvement

- Identified process/automation weakness that could lead to repeated compliance gaps or check failures

- Image vulnerability gap
